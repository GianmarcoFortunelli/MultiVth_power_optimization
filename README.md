# Multi-V<sub>th</sub> Power Optimization Algorithm

This project implements a **multi-threshold voltage (multi-V<sub>th</sub>) power optimization algorithm** developed for the **Low Power Contest 2025** as part of the **SODS** course at Politecnico di Torino.  
Its goal is to **reduce leakage power in digital circuits** by selectively replacing cells with higher-V<sub>th</sub> alternatives, while ensuring **timing constraints** and **critical path requirements** are preserved.
